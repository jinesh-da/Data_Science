    "**Ans-**  Python is a widely-used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was initially designed by **Guido van Rossum** in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code. The two of the most used versions has to Python 2.x & 3.x"

    "**Ans-** Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data and code. The data is in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and the code is in the form of procedures (often known as methods). Structured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs of selection (if/then/else) and repetition (while and for), block structures, and subroutines. Functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program."

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "**Ans-** Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager. The Python memory manager has different components which deal with various dynamic storage management aspects, like sharing, segmentation, preallocation or caching. It is important to understand that the management of the Python heap is performed by the interpreter itself and that the user has no control over it, even if they regularly manipulate object pointers to memory blocks inside that heap. The allocation of heap space for Python objects and other internal buffers is performed on demand by the Python memory manager through the Python/C API functions listed in this document. The memory is allocated during the execution of instructions written by programmers. Note that the name heap has nothing to do with the heap data structure. It is called heap because it is a pile of memory space available to programmers to allocated and de-allocate. The variables are needed outside of method or function calls or are shared within multiple functions globally are stored in Heap memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Garbage collection** is a process in which the interpreter frees up the memory when not in use to make it available for other objects. Assume a case where no reference is pointing to an object in memory i.e. it is not in use so, the virtual machine has a garbage collector that automatically deletes that object from the heap memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference counting** works by counting the number of times an object is referenced by other objects in the system. When references to an object are removed, the reference count for an object is decremented. When the reference count becomes zero, the object is deallocated."

    "    1. Simple to use: Syntax of Python is simple and easy to adapt. Python's fundamentals can be implemented faster than those  in other programming languages.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Free and Open Source: Python is distributed under an open-source license approved by the Open-Source Initiative (OSI).  As a result, users can work on it and distribute it. Users can download the source code, modify it, and even distribute their Python version.\n",
    "    3. Extensive Library: Python includes a huge number of libraries that the user can use. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. Interpreted language: It is an interpreted language, implying that the code is implemented line by line. This is one of the features that makes it simple to use. In the event of an error, it halts the process and reports the problem. Python only shows one error, even if the program has multiple errors. This makes debugging easier.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5. Dynamicaly typed: Until we run the program, Python has no idea what kinds of parameter we're talking about. It allocates the data type automatically during execution. Variables and their data types do not need to be declared by the programmer.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    6. Portablility: It only needs to be written once, and then it can be run anywhere. "
